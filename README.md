# FccURLshortener

This is a mini project that I am doing as part of the FCC microservices and API certification. It uses the express, nodeJS, and MongooseJS libraries to store input URLs and outputs a shortened version. This project helped me practice components of the MEAN stack. This was also good Regex practice.
